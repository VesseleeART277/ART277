<p><b>Exotic dance moves</b></p>
<p>
Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To</p>
<p>answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p></div>
  
 <div style="margin:6px 0px 0px; padding:8px;font-size:8px"><p> Polynesian chicken dance </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <dd>
        
  A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village</p>
<p>would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p></div>

<p style ="font-size:8px">Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
<div style="margin:0px;0px; padding;08px;font-size:8px">
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <dd>
        
Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice
this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling
their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow
students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</div>
<div style="font-size:8px; padding:8px">
<p>Anctic robot dance</p>
<div>
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <dd>
        <p>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s
believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted
movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on
however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really
cold.</p></div><br>
