<p>  When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought
  me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has
  given me a unique learning experience.</p>
  <p>At five, I <a href="https://starzit.com/student-resource/starzit.com">marveled</a> at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided Venetian waterways 
  on sleek </p><p>gondolas.
  At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stone henge and </p>

 <p> It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first
  became interested in language.</p>
 <p>It began with French, which taught me the importance of
  pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris
  where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it
  PR-A-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more accent on
  the A, she looked at me bewildered.</p><p>
  In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and
  aware of its similarities with English through cognates.
  Baseball in Spanish, for example, is,which looks
  different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to</div>

  me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates
  come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. <a href="Send Us Email.html">Send Us Email</a></p><p>
  Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my
  school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I</p>
<div style="font-size:6px">
  
<p> loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning <br>mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.</p><br>
