<p> loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning <br>mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.</p><br>
